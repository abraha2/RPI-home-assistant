## Welcome to custoblocks-voice-assistant!
  The very first open source, fully customisable, voice assistant for the Raspberry Pi!

<i>Come see [our wiki!](https://github.com/abraha2/custoblocks-voice-assistant/wiki)</i>

  <i>This code was inspired by (and partly borrowed from) Programming Hero, a YouTuber who aims to make coding more fun, for everyone.</i>

In order to use this application, you may need [some basic Python skills.](https://www.learnpython.org/)

### The Basics (more info coming, later):

platform: latest Raspbery Pi OS, runnng on the Raspberry Pi

Hotword (that word you say to make it listen): "system command"

How to install:<br>
After navigating to the repository's folder in the shell window, execute this command:<br>
`sudo ./setup.sh`<br>
in the terminal. This will install all the necessary python packages, to run the assistant

All of the supported commands are listed, in some detail, in the main.py file
